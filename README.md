# SlidingSubMenu 
This component is designed to create a sliding submenu for a React Native application. The submenu opens when one of the three main group icons (My Bulletin, LIVE, PRE-MATCH) is clicked and expands horizontally to reveal the submenu icons (Football, Ice Hockey, Handball, Long Term, MMA). First, it does it according to what is clicked in the main menus. Then it does it according to what is clicked in the submenu.

## Features  
-  Navigation bar with three main group icons: My Bulletin, LIVE, PRE-MATCH.
- Sliding animation to reveal the submenu icons.
- Submenu icons for filtering data based on their corresponding categories (e.g., Football, Basketball).
- Method invocation on submenu icon click to filter data.
